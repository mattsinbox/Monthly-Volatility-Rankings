# Monthly-Volatility-Rankings

## Introduction:
Monthly Volatility Ranking is a Jupyter notebook written in python that ultimately tranforms and analyzes daily market data
with respect to it's _monthly _volatility.  

## Motivation:
Many market forecasters and pundits will reference certain months or seasons with respect to their volatilities without any data to 
substantiate their claims.  I wanted to create a program that could take a csv file with basic daily market information, Open, High, Low,
Change etc....and transform it to a dataframe which ranks the month by it's volatility within a given year and for a 
user defined time frame.  After transformation, users could use the dataframe to 
run visuals, perform statistical operations and feed the rankings into a machine learning algorithm.  This notebook could be 
used to analyze and transform daily data from a variety of markets to help determine seasonality.    

## Install:
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np

from IPython.display import display # Allows the use of display() for DataFrames
Pretty display for notebooks: %matplotlib inline
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

## Contributing
Monthly-Volatility-Rankings was originally written by Matthew Aronowitz.  I intend on improving this software to further enhance 
the automation of the transfomation, visualizations and analysis.
